An easy-to-use Node.js library for Signing in with Apple!

Apple has starteed to issue access tokens and show the Sign in with Apple flow, but the access token is only reserved for future use. As of now, you cannot fetch any information from that access token but in the future it will be possible.

Live example running on <a href="https://apple.exun.co">https://apple.exun.co</a>

## Setup / Usage / Example

Begin by installing the library:
```npm install apple-auth```

The configurations for Sign in with Apple are quite extensive so I've made an extensive SETUP.md file that you can read
https://github.com/ananay/apple-auth/blob/master/SETUP.md

The setup, usage and example are all included here

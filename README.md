<h1 align="center">Sign in with Apple for NodeJS</h1>

An easy-to-use Node.js library for Signing in with Apple!

## Setup

Begin by installing the library:
```npm install apple-auth```

The configurations for Sign in with Apple are quite extensive so I've made an extensive SETUP.md file that you can read
https://github.com/ananay/apple-auth/blob/master/SETUP.md
